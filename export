; The ‘export’ command is one of the essential built-in commands in the Bash shell, allowing users to manage environment variables effectively.

; In Bash, environment variables are set when you start a new shell session, 
; and changes to these variables are not automatically picked up by the shell. 


; Without any argument: 
> export

; To view all exported variables on current shell
> export -p
